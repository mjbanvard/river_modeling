# river_modeling

## Scope of this project
Using the available USGS APIs:
1. Create model [Measured Point Model (MPM)] of any instance of any measured point (MP) in a waterway.
2. Use AI/ML to create approximated data between MPs.
3. Multiple consecutive MPMs to create 3D slideshow of A Moment In Time (AMIT).
4. Animate Slideshow through time. Use AI to stitch together AMITs into an animated model of a waterway.

### Cards to place
Find map of locations on river
- each station should have location in DB package
- zoom in zoom out
MP data?
- what data
 #### USGS, NWIS
- which systems overlap?
- layers of measurement?
Visual representation/spectra of data to display
