# river_modeling

## Scope of this project
Using the available USGS APIs:
1. Create model [Measured Point Model (MPM)] of any instance of any measured point (MP) in a waterway.
2. Use AI/ML to create approximated data between MPs.
3. Multiple consecutive MPMs to create 3D slideshow of A Moment In Time (AMIT).
4. Animate Slideshow through time. Use AI to stitch together AMITs into an animated model of a waterway.
